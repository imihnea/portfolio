Developed a responsive marketing website for Tactical Heroes 2: Platoons using Svelte framework. The project demanded precise implementation from Photoshop design files, translating static assets into an optimized, production-ready web experience.

Technical implementation:

- Framework: Svelte for efficient component-based architecture
- Design fidelity: Pixel-perfect PSD to HTML/CSS conversion
- Responsive engineering: Mobile optimization within desktop-first design parameters
- Performance: Optimized asset delivery and rendering performance

The project demonstrates proficiency in modern JavaScript frameworks, attention to design detail, and the ability to enhance user experience across diverse device profiles while working within established design constraints.
