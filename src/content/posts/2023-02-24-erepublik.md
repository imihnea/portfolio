As a long-term contractor with eRepublik Labs, I serve as the lead front-end developer for their flagship titles erepublik.com and warandpeace.com. Over four years, I have led comprehensive modernization initiatives for these established browser-based games, managing complex technical migrations while maintaining service for a global user base.

**Technical Modernization**

- **Framework Migration**: Led complete migration from AngularJS to Vue.js, modernizing the entire front-end architecture
- **Build System Overhaul**: Replaced legacy Grunt and NodeSass compilers with modern build tooling
- **Component Architecture**: Developed reusable component libraries for consistent UI patterns
- **Legacy Integration**: Maintained jQuery compatibility for critical legacy systems during transition

**Key Responsibilities**

- Complete front-end ownership across multiple game titles
- Systematic refactoring and codebase modernization
- New feature development and UI revamps
- Performance optimization and maintainability improvements
- Cross-functional collaboration in Agile development environment

**Additional Projects**

Within eRepublik Labs, I also contributed to Game of Nations, developing responsive web interfaces that integrate Web3 functionality with traditional gaming mechanics, enhancing overall gameplay and user engagement.

This ongoing engagement demonstrates expertise in large-scale technical migrations, legacy system modernization, and sustainable long-term development practices for production applications serving global audiences.
