My involvement in this project was quite extensive, given that Erepublik is a relatively old game that has been around for 15 years. As detailed in my "About me" page, I have been the sole front-end web developer for almost 4 years. During this time, I have refactored numerous implementations of various elements throughout the website and cleaned up a considerable portion of the codebase. Angular is the main framework used, along with a significant amount of Jquery. The reason for Jquery's heavy use is due to the website's age.

While I cannot divulge many details about the backend and deployment aspects, I can confidently say that I was involved in creating or modifying most of the visuals that are present on the website today, particularly those added in the past 4 years.

I would like to invite you to create an account and play the game to get a better understanding of the project's depth.
