War and Peace represents eRepublik Labs' flagship product and primary revenue driver, generating over half of the company's total revenue through its integrated webshop. As the lead front-end developer for this project, I have been responsible for critical infrastructure improvements, payment system integration, and ongoing feature development in close collaboration with the art team.

**Revenue-Critical Development**

The webshop serves as the primary monetization channel for War and Peace, requiring exceptional attention to reliability, user experience, and conversion optimization. My work directly impacts the company's bottom line through:

- Payment system migration to Stillfront's enterprise infrastructure
- Seamless transaction processing and checkout flow optimization
- Revenue tracking and analytics integration
- A/B testing implementation for conversion rate optimization

**Technical Achievements**

**Payment System Overhaul**
- Complete migration from legacy payment infrastructure to Stillfront's enterprise payment platform
- Integration with multiple payment gateways and processors
- PCI compliance implementation and security hardening
- Transaction monitoring and error handling systems

**Route Architecture Refactoring**
- Complete restructure of application routing for improved scalability
- Performance optimization through code splitting and lazy loading
- SEO improvements and URL structure optimization
- Enhanced navigation patterns and user flow

**In-Game Event Implementation**
- Dynamic event-driven webshop features tied to game mechanics
- Real-time inventory management and limited-time offer systems
- Custom promotional campaigns and seasonal events
- Integration with game backend for synchronized state management

**Design Collaboration**
- Close partnership with art team for design implementation
- Iterative design refinement and feedback integration
- Pixel-perfect translation of design specifications to production code
- Custom animations and interactive elements enhancing user engagement

**Ongoing Development**

As an ongoing project within my long-term eRepublik Labs engagement, War and Peace continues to receive regular updates, new features, and optimizations. The webshop's success demonstrates capability in high-stakes development where code quality and reliability directly impact business performance.
