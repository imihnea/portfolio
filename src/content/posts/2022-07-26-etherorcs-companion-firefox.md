I have started working on a Firefox extension that served two purposes to me: removing the shadow effect placed upon the character for immersion and clearing all the game animations for instant loading and faster dungeon clears.

I've always enjoyed speed-running in games, so making an extension to reduce my clear times and play more efficiently seemed the logical thing to do, especially since it's not frowned upon.

Since creating the extension I've found out another extension for Chrome made by one of the top EtherOrcs holders, [Blumentopf](https://github.com/blumentopf-eth). You can find his extension [here](https://github.com/blumentopf-eth/etherorcs-helper). I've imported the features implemented by him into my extension, so that anyone who wants to use them has the ability to.

In the future I plan to expand the extension with more features that I might find necessary for a more time-efficient gaming experience.
