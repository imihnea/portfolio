description: I had the opportunity to work on an exciting web project recently,
  creating a blog website using Ghost CMS. The website can be accessed through
  the link above. The client requested a theme that would showcase their content
  in the best possible way. I took on the task of enhancing and adapting a
  pre-existing theme to meet the client's needs. The project didn't require any
  particular framework, but the theme used Handlebars as a templating system
  with styles written in SCSS and Javascript bundled up in a few files before
  uploading the project to the Ghost platform.

I had the opportunity to work on an exciting web project recently, creating a blog website using Ghost CMS. The website can be accessed through the link above. The client requested a theme that would showcase their content in the best possible way. I took on the task of enhancing and adapting a pre-existing theme to meet the client's needs. The project didn't require any particular framework, but the theme used Handlebars as a templating system with styles written in SCSS and Javascript bundled up in a few files before uploading the project to the Ghost platform.

Apart from theme customization, I also handled everything related to hosting and payments via Stripe, which enabled the client to focus solely on creating content. Setting up the hosting platform required me to choose a reliable hosting service provider that would meet the client's requirements. I ensured that the website was accessible, secure, and performing optimally. I also handled the payment aspect, ensuring that the client could easily receive payments from their audience. This involved setting up a payment gateway that was user-friendly and reliable.

Additionally, I provided the client with continuous support in regards to hosting and further development. This meant that I was available to provide assistance with any issues that arose during the website's day-to-day operations. Furthermore, if the client needed any further development or enhancements to their website in the future, I would be available to assist them. Overall, it was a fulfilling project that allowed me to showcase my skills and help a content creator establish their online presence.
