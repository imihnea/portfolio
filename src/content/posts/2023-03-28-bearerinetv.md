description: I had the opportunity to work on an exciting web project recently,
  creating a blog website using Ghost CMS. The website can be accessed through
  the link above. The client requested a theme that would showcase their content
  in the best possible way. I took on the task of enhancing and adapting a
  pre-existing theme to meet the client's needs. The project didn't require any
  particular framework, but the theme used Handlebars as a templating system
  with styles written in SCSS and Javascript bundled up in a few files before
  uploading the project to the Ghost platform.
