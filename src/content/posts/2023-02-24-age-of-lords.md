Developed a responsive marketing website for Age of Lords using Svelte as the core framework. The project required precise implementation from design specifications provided in Photoshop PSD format, ensuring pixel-perfect translation to production code.

Technical approach:

- Framework: Svelte for optimal performance and minimal bundle size
- Design implementation: High-fidelity conversion from PSD to responsive web components
- Responsive optimization: Enhanced mobile experience despite desktop-first design constraints
- Deliverables: Production-ready static website with cross-device compatibility

This project showcases expertise in rapid development with modern JavaScript frameworks while maintaining strict adherence to design specifications and delivering optimized user experiences across all device types.
