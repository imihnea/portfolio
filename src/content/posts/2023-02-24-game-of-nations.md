For this project, I was tasked with porting a mobile game shop to a web-based platform. Essentially, the mobile application contained all the necessary information and designs that needed to be implemented as a website. The primary framework used in this project was Svelte, and the website had to be launched in time for the Ethereals event.

In addition to the game shop, the Ethereals event required a few webshop sections and a whitepaper that described the purpose and other relevant information. While I did not have a mobile implementation for these pages, I was provided with a few Photoshop PSD files to work with.

I would like to invite you to create an account and play the game. Personally, I find it very enjoyable, and I think you will too.
