T﻿he scope of this project was porting a mobile game shop to a web based one. Basically, the mobile application contained all the information and designs required, my job was to implement them as a website, for the launch of the Ethereals event. T﻿he main framework used is Svelte.

T﻿he Ethereals also came along with a few webshop sections and a whitepaper describing their purpose and other info. For these pages I did not have a mobile implementation, but a few Photoshop PSD files.

I﻿ invite you to create an account and play a bit, I personally really enjoy this game.
