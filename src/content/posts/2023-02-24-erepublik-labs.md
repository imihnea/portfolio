Developed the corporate website for eRepublik Labs, creating a professional landing page with custom-tailored code optimized for the company's brand identity. The project required precise implementation from Figma design specifications, delivering a polished web presence for the gaming studio.

Technical approach:

- Implementation: Custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript for maximum flexibility and control
- Design fidelity: Pixel-perfect conversion from Figma mockups to production code
- Responsive optimization: Full mobile and tablet responsiveness across all sections
- Performance: Lightweight, fast-loading static site with optimized assets

This project demonstrates versatility in approach—choosing custom implementation over framework dependencies when appropriate—while maintaining the same high standards of design accuracy and user experience delivery.
