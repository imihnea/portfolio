**Welcome! Nice to have you here!**

As of this moment, I am immersed in the world of web development, working as a contractor on multiple exciting projects simultaneously. For the past four years, I've been passionately crafting the front-end of a captivating browser game. My work primarily revolves around JavaScript, skillfully wielding frameworks like Angular and Svelte, all while seamlessly integrating HTML and CSS to create engaging, user-friendly interfaces.

My journey in the digital realm didn't start here. Before embarking on this browser game odyssey, I dabbled in the traditional Web2 startup scene and ventured into the cryptocurrency industry. In fact, my initial foray into the professional world was as an intern at one of the prominent crypto trading companies in my country, Bitcoin Romania.

In the last year, I embarked on a thrilling endeavor, constructing a cutting-edge project that employed Svelte as the front-end framework. This venture was an exhilarating fusion of Web3 elements into conventional Web2 gaming, and I'm delighted to share it with you. The resulting creation, Game of Nations, has now found its place in my portfolio.

My journey didn't stop there. Following the success of Game of Nations, I set my sights on War and Peace, a game sharing a similar concept but imbued with a unique stylistic approach. Simultaneously, I continue to be deeply involved with eRepublik, one of my primary projects.

Beyond these immersive experiences, I've also embraced smaller projectsâ€”constructing simple, static websites with mobile-friendly layouts. These were designed to immortalize and enhance the gaming experience for titles that had met their closure at the game studio where I contribute. Notably, projects like Age of Lords, Game of Trenches, and Tactical Heroes 2 Platoons were among these endeavors. I find working on static websites to be a foundational skill that every front-end developer should master, as exemplified by this very portfolio website.

All the projects I've described are meticulously cataloged in my portfolio section, which I wholeheartedly invite you to explore. This is where my journey has led me today, and I am excited to embark on new collaborations with clients, tackle fresh projects, and embrace emerging technologies.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey.
