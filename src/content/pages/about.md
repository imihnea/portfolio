**Welcome! Nice to have you here!** ... is what I would've wanted to hear when I joined the NFT space in December 2021. It feels like it's been years since then, when it has barely even been a single year. It's been quite a ride, for sure, but not so much on the builder side, mostly slinging Jpegs here and there for ETH, WETH and MAGIC.

I've had the pleasure of meeting lots of cool people in the space in the past year. Learned a ton about what NFT traders and gamers are looking for. Coming from a gaming background myself, I've always leaned towards gaming projects and ecosystems such as **EtherOrcs** and the **TreasureDAO** ecosystem with their token MAGIC. EtherOrcs is my current favorite project in the NFT space due to their innovation and aesthetics. I've always been a fan of pixel games and World of Warcraft I still play from time to time, so it was definitely the right fit.

Unfortunately I've realized that I'm not cut for trading. Even though I've managed to pull some sweet flips, the trader life is not for me. Watching charts all day, trying hard for whitelists, scanning top active collections, checking alpha groups non-stop to gauge the overall sentiment of what's currently trending, most of it is *really* exhausting.

This is where life came in. At the time of writing this, at my current workplace, I've been working on the front-end of a browser game for 3.5 years, which consists of mostly writing Javascript with an Angular framework, besides the usual Html/Css which get mixed in with the Php templating and Sass styling for faster development. Before this I had experience with starting a traditional Web2 startup and working in the crypto industry on the same front. My first internship was actually at one of the biggest crypto trading companies in my country.

I﻿n the past months I've been working on a brand new project using Svelte as the front-end framework, which was a nice surprise as I always enjoy learning new things. I can't say much about the project at the moment but the goal is to start implementing Web3 elements into Web2 games, which is really exciting!

B﻿esides this project and the browser game I've also taken up a few smaller projects which consisted of simple static websites with mobile friendly layouts for a few of the games that were shut down at the game studio I am working for. It was refreshing working on some static websites too as I believe those are one of the bread and butter of any front-end developer. Case in point: this portfolio website as well.

This is where I am today. Excited to take up on new clients, new projects and new technologies!
