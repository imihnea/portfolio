**Professional Frontend Developer | 7 Years Experience**

I am a frontend web developer specializing in modern JavaScript frameworks, scalable web applications, and end-to-end project delivery. With 7 years of professional experience, I have successfully delivered projects focusing on front-end development with strong backend integration, infrastructure management, and payment systems capabilities across multiple industries.

**Core Expertise**

- **Front-End Development**: Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Svelte, React - building responsive, performant user interfaces
- **Backend Integration**: API consumption and development, database design, server-side integration
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Hosting configuration, deployment pipelines, security implementation
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe and other payment gateway implementations
- **Gaming Industry**: Interactive webshops, event-driven features, revenue-critical systems

**Professional Background**

My professional journey began with a focused three-month web development bootcamp, building upon my computer science foundation from university and high school. This led to early experience with Agile methodologies, scrum workflows, and international team collaboration with colleagues based in Canada.

I co-founded Deal Your Crypto, a fintech platform where I led front-end development while contributing to backend implementation and managing business operations. The venture secured European Union grant funding and gained media attention through local television coverage, providing invaluable experience in startup development and strategic decision-making.

Currently, I work as a long-term contractor with eRepublik Labs on a B2B basis, contributing to their flagship titles erepublik.com and warandpeace.com. Over the past four years, I have led comprehensive modernization initiatives including:

- Complete migration from AngularJS to Vue.js
- Build system modernization: replaced legacy Grunt and NodeSass with modern tooling
- UI revamps and new feature implementations
- Development of reusable component libraries
- Codebase refactoring for improved maintainability

**Recent Projects**

My portfolio demonstrates versatility across multiple domains:

- **Game of Nations**: Mobile-to-web platform migration with integrated marketplace features and event-driven commerce systems
- **Bearerine**: Complete Ghost CMS implementation including theme development, hosting infrastructure, Stripe payment integration, and ongoing technical support
- **Multiple Gaming Websites**: Svelte-based marketing sites for Age of Lords, Game of Trenches, and Tactical Heroes 2, showcasing rapid development and pixel-perfect design implementation

**Technical Approach**

I specialize in translating complex requirements into production-ready solutions, whether modernizing legacy systems or building greenfield projects. My experience spans individual contributor roles to technical leadership positions, always maintaining focus on code quality, user experience, and business objectives.

**Current Focus**

I am available for contract engagements and new client projects, particularly those involving:
- Modern frontend application development (SPA, SSR, static sites)
- Legacy frontend system modernization and refactoring
- End-to-end project delivery with backend and infrastructure integration
- E-commerce and payment system frontend implementation
- Technical consulting and frontend architecture planning

All projects referenced are available in the portfolio section with detailed case studies and visual examples.
